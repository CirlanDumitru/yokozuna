Yokozuna
==========

_Yokozuna_ - Horizontal rope.  The top rank in sumo, usually
translated _Grand Champion_.  The name comes from the rope a yokozuna
wears.

The goal of the Yokozuna application is to integrate Apache Solr with
Riak in order to find the "top rank" documents for a given query.

**NOTICE:** Yokozuna is the new search implementation for Riak 2.0.0,
  replacing the old riak_search repository. Breaking changes may occur
  at any point up until the final Riak 2.0.0 release. Download
  [Riak 2.0.0beta1][riak2beta] to try Yokozuna today.


For more information on using Yokozuna see the
[official Riak Search documentation][search-docs].
